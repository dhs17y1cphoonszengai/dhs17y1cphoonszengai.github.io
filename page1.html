<h1>Review of Fantastic Beast and where to find them</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s still a lot to enjoy in </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic Beasts</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&rsquo;s never unpleasant to luxuriate in Rowling&rsquo;s wizarding world, and the movie is full of the little side gags that always populate both her books and these movies. (The &ldquo;Niffler&rdquo; is going to be filling a lot of holiday stockings.) These are warm-hearted films that do more good than harm: The plot lines move along quickly, and they generally make sure to provide a good lesson. But </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Potter </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt compelled to exist, as if Rowling knew she was producing her life&rsquo;s work and wanted to nail down every detail. Here, it feels again like an extension of world that she&mdash;and Warner Bros.&mdash;loved so much they didn&rsquo;t want to leave it. I suspect you&rsquo;ll want to hang out more in this world, rather that spend time with the wizards at the center of it. It</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">just feels a little more </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">wheezing </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">than you&rsquo;d like it to. You think that&rsquo;s a problem now? Just wait: We&rsquo;ve got another decade of these movies left to go.</span></p>
