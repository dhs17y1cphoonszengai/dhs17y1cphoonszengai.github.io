   <h2>Movie Review</h2>
     <p>The film strains considerably under the weight of all these plot lines—it’s never fun to be the movie with the origin story. Newt, Tina, and the gang spend an inordinate amount of time tracking down all those creatures, which keeps them busy while the plot itself unspools, seemingly in the background. And I’m sorry to say that their story is not particularly compelling. Redmayne and Waterson are both terrific, charismatic actors, but they’re both tamped down here, particularly Redmayne, who is so obligated to be “whimsical” in the Rowling sense that he barely enunciates his dialogue, seemingly whispering all of it out the side of his mouth. He is so good-hearted, simple, and nondescript that it’s sort of crazy that he’s going to be the centerpiece of four or five more films. He isn’t given more motivation than “loves animals,” and an eleventh-hour attempt to give him a sad backstory feels more tacked on than anything else. Farrell is a potentially worthy villain, but he has nothing much to do more than glower and, in the climax, give way to a much more famous, but far less enjoyable, movie star. (When this “surprise” movie star is revealed, I swear, half my theater groaned.)
There’s still a lot to enjoy in Fantastic Beasts. It’s never unpleasant to luxuriate in Rowling’s wizarding world, and the movie is full of the little side gags that always populate both her books and these movies. (The “Niffler” is going to be filling a lot of holiday stockings.) These are warm-hearted films that do more good than harm: The plot lines move along quickly, and they generally make sure to provide a good lesson. But Harry Potter felt compelled to exist, as if Rowling knew she was producing her life’s work and wanted to nail down every detail. Here, it feels again like an extension of world that she—and Warner Bros.—loved so much they didn’t want to leave it. I suspect you’ll want to hang out more in this world, rather that spend time with the wizards at the center of it. It
just feels a little more wheezing than you’d like it to. You think that’s a problem now? Just wait: We’ve got another decade of these movies left to go.
